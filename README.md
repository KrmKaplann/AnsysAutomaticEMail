# AnsysAutomaticEMail

Receive an email from Ansys when the analysis is completed or if you get error...

With the Python code snippet I've prepared, you will receive an email about the completion of the analysis once it's done. 

If there is an error and the analysis is incomplete, you will be notified of this situation; if the analysis is completed, you will receive an email containing the figures you have added.

This way, if you are not at your PC, you won't need to constantly check it. Additionally, in case of convergence issues or any errors, restarting the analysis can help you use your time more efficiently.
